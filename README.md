# ReceiptGenerator
This program aims to simulate printing a receipt for any business. My aim is to make this fully customizable and plan on adding more things in the future slowly, This is just a fun side project.

To add or change items to the menu, just add them in the menu file

To add or change prices in the menu, just add them in the price file

Make sure each item and price is on their corresponding lines and that each file has the same amount of line.

This program is supposed to simulate the end result of an order, not an entire POS system.
